#summary Strategic short-term and long-term todo items for plop

Small tactical todos are now files as issues - this page now lists only more general todos of strategic importance

= Short-term =

  * Extend the current trivial hillclimber to encompass lists, tuples, and functions
  * Extend the plop minilanguage to action-perception and enum types. Think more carefully about side-effects.
  * Implement a non-trivial learning algorithm
  * Implement nontrivial representation-building for "flat" knobs
  * Implemented deme management
  * Run some interesting benchmarks on Boolean & real-valued & mixed datasets

= Long-term =

  * Implement procedural abstraction via datamining & via direct transformation
  * Primitive-recursive operations and associated transformations via either fold or explicit recursion
  * Run benchmarks on the [Benchmarks full set of benchmarks]
  * Exploiting uncertain background knowledge, learning coupling rules, metalearning
